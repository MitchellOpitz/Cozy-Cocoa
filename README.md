Cozy Cocoa is a casual simulation game where you manage a hot cocoa stand.  Fill customer orders and earn as much money as you can!  (You get bonus tips if you work quickly!)

This game was made over 48 hours for the [Winter MelonJam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/winter-melonjam-2022) game jam.  This project is no longer being actively developed.

The final game submission can be played directly in your browser here: [Cocy Cocoa on itch.io](https://mitchellopitz.itch.io/cozy-cocoa).

# Inspiration

This game was inspired by a local church that puts on a HUGE Christmas lights display every year.  Throughout the park, they have several hot cocoa stands.  And we always stop to get some cocoa or cider.  It's a happy memory for us and certainly makes us cozy!
